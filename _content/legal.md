The data on farm subsidy payments that is available on farmsubsidy.org is drawn
from many different government sources. In some cases the source data have
errors which we have not yet detected and in other cases the data has been
provided in very complex and impenetrable formats, which may have given rise to
errors in the way it is presented on farmsubsidy.org.

While we will strive to root out any errors in the data presented on
farmsubsidy.org, unless the European Union agrees to provide a single,
consistent and comparable dataset of farm subsidy payments, it is difficult to
be sure there are no inaccuracies that escaped our notice.

Under no circumstances will we be liable for any of the following losses or
damage (whether such losses where foreseen, foreseeable, known or otherwise):
(a) loss of data; (b) loss of revenue or anticipated profits; (c) loss of
business; (d) loss of opportunity; (e) loss of goodwill or injury to
reputation; (f) losses suffered by third parties; or (g) any indirect,
consequential, special or exemplary damages arising from the use of
farmsubsidy.org regardless of the form of action.

We do not warrant that functions contained in farmsubsidy.org content will be
uninterrupted or error free, that defects will be corrected, or that
farmsubsidy.org or the server that makes it available are free of viruses or
bugs.
